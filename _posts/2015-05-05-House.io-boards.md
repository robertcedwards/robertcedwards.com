<p class="intro">Working with new technologies is always exciting because each day there are thousands of innovations that make building things easy, faster, and of course cheaper.
For this project I want to make a simple and easy to use home automation platform that relied on cheap and readily available parts.

The functionality covers:
433mhz sender and receiver for control of outlets and reading of sensors.
Neopixel strip lighting.
IR Control for home entertainment control.
Temperature and Humidity sensor.
