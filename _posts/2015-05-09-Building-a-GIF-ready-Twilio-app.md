I've been fascinated by the current trend of message apps like PIP, KIK, and others of the sort.
The one thing that has surprised me is that the majority of the apps require you to force your friends in order to message them from the app.
The interesting trend is the single serving apps like Yo!, Beer, and a whole host of clones that come to serve our every last simple messaging needs.
I want to make a version of all of them housed under one roof so you could easily text message your friends using predetermined messages and an easy to use interface.
Simply tap a message, tap a name or group, and send.
