I've been building a number of IOT devices and experiments. It tends to be easy to get a few simple hardware devices up and running, reading some data and logging it. It is more difficult and complex to build a platform or system that bring all of those endpoints together and can display and act in a convenient manner.

One of the intersting ways to accomplish this without the need for a database and server-side code is to use a platform like Mixpanel.
I have a previous post and project that involve a Particle.io board (a Core specifically) and Mixpanel.
The problem is Mixpanel doesn't have an easy way to display your data once it's logged in Mixpanel. You can log in and use the Mixpanel interface to sort and segment your data, but that more for notificaitions and communicating with segmented groups of your users.
I really want a system that can warehouse my data and then display it in a customizable interface.
